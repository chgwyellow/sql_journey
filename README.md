# Notes

## What is Database?

- A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface.
- MySQL is actually not a database, it's a **database management system** which interacts with the database.

## Database and Tables

### Database

- Database contents lots of tables, so you can say database is just **a bunch of tables**.
- The key word "**USE**" can specify the database we would like to use, and "**SELECT**" can tell us what is the database we are using now.
- In GUI, double click the database can switch database easily.

### Table

- The true heart of SQL!
- a collection of related data held in a **structured** format within a database.

#### Data Type

- **INT**
  - Stands for integer, it's a whole number.
- **Varchar**
  - Stands for **Variable-length** string.
